CSS 
cascading style sheet
it is used to make web layout
types
 internal css ->written inside <head></head> tag
 external css ->written in external page which has extension.css
inline css ->writen in tag itself eg <h1 style="">...</h1>

basic syntax:

selector{
	properties:value;
	eg: color:red;
	} 

intial scale no zoom in and in out and so IS is always 1.0
tag selctor select tag of h1 for style changes
tag doesnt need any notation but
class has . notation to pass to head tag
and id needs # tag to pass to " "

using comma to two heading at same tag
is called grouping selector selector which has more than two heading/group tag which require only one style.

Universal selector
uses astreix notation* for whole page for the same style

Border 
to create a box we use division
note:we cannot use border in form login/signup form therefore we can use outline to replacing it

Note to learn Margin and Padding
